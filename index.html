			<h2>Designing for People</h2>
			<p>In a city, a Place is inhabited by people. Places include homes, shops, and parks. A Non-Place is not inhabited by people. Non-places include roads, warehouses, and empty space. A city of mostly Non-Places would hardly be a city. Why is it, then, that so much space in modern cities is dedicated to empty fields of pavement? <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2013/11/27/optimizing-the-street-grid.html">Austin, Texas is almost half streets by area.</a> After parking lots and other car-only spaces, Austin looks more like a city for cars than one for people.</p>

			<p>When a city is designed for cars, it naturally sprawls out, making it only more necessary to design for cars. A human being in this environment must drive everywhere, and because nobody is walking, nobody makes an effort to appeal to passerby. What you get is an inefficient, alienating, ugly city.</p>

			<h2>Street Hierarchy</h2>
			<p>If the streets are in use, one might think they are a necessity of the area's density. However, they are only a necessity of lazy design. A city with well-placed hierarchical streets can stray from the grid and divert traffic into areas designed for traffic, away from areas designed for people. Basically, this separates the Places and Non-Places.</p>
